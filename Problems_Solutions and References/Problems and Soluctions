Problem's Category : Application Server Installation
    Server Type : Tomcat
    Problem Context : After installing the Tomcat directory in a system's directory like /opt i got problems of permissi-
                      ons, so i recommend install the Tomcat's directory in the user's home directory.

                      You can get the Tomcat 9 Directory from its official site :
                         https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi

                      You can follow the steps in the following web site :
                        https://tecadmin.net/install-tomcat-9-on-ubuntu/

                      Give the permission for Intellij to access and copy Catalina.sh :
                        chmod 777 .../tomcat9/bin/Catalina.sh

                      Try to start tomcat9 Server :
                        chmod +x .../tomcat9/bin/startup.sh
                        cd .../tomcat9/bin/ -> ./startup.sh

                      If it works, turn it off, to make its port available for intellij, normally it's 8080
                           chmod +x .../tomcat9/bin/shutdown.sh
                           cd .../tomcat9/bin/ -> ./shutdown.sh

                      Define the Tomcat Application Server for your project in Intellij.
                           Run the server. Now you JSP file should be executed and viewed in the browser at localhost:8080

Problem's Category : JSP file can't compile the sources which include libraries like org.apache......Analyzer :
    Solution :
        I had to copy the libraries directory to _RI_/web/WEB-INF. so the web module WEB can recognize it.
        This step had to be done because the web module let us specify the sources directory /src in our case, but
        don't give the possibility to specify the libraries directory. So we have to know that it's cover range for
        the import libraries ins project/web directory. not the hole project.
