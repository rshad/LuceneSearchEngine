## LuceneSearchEngine
  #### - Category: 
  It's a JavaEE Application
  #### - Main Description:
  Using Lucene 7.1 to design a simple search engine over Granada University's web pages.

#### Description:
- In Information Recovery subject of the last course of Computer Science Engineering degree, I got to design a search engine using 
  Lucene 7.1 as the core of the egine. 

#### I followed the next steps:
  1. Study the purpose of the engine.
  2. Study the querys's types, content and natural.
  3. Make a basic design to start improving it by each step I work on.
  4. Design the Indexer class.
  5. Test the Indexer class with examples, using Tika software:
      - The main index desing and implementation.
      - The facets index design and implementation.
  6. Design and implement the "Searcher" 
  7. Test the searcher.
  8. Improve the searcher by adding more query's types results's filters.
  9. Design the user interface, using JavaEE and Tomcat server.
  
 
#### Project Structure
In src directory, you can find the application main code files " the hole aplication without the interface code files ".
In web directory, you can find the total files, related to the user interface and the server configuration.
In Problems_Solutions and References, you can find the coding problems and bugs I faced during the implementation of the application with the solutions "how I resolved the bugs".
